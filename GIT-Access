The IRCd-Damon Git repository can be checked out using the following command:
	git clone git://github.com/iqbalniazi/IRCd-Damon.git
 
 
 
IRCd-Damon's Git repository depot can be browsed over the internet at 
the following address:
	http://github.com/iqbalniazi/IRCd-Damon$Id: SVN-Access 23020 2006-09-01 18:20:19Z androsyn $

So, we've gone and switched to subversion.

The ircd-ratbox subversion repository is available for anonymous access.

One can checkout the stable tree(currently 2.0.x) as follows:

svn co http://svn.ratbox.org/svnroot/ircd-ratbox/branches/RATBOX_2_0

Or the testing tree(2.1.x):

svn co http://svn.ratbox.org/svnroot/ircd-ratbox/branches/RATBOX_2_1

Or if you prefer the bleeding edge stuff:

svn co http://svn.ratbox.org/svnroot/ircd-ratbox/trunk

Of course at any given time the SVN tree could be broken.  If you are
planning on using the SVN tree you very well may want to be on the mailing
list, you can subscribe at:
