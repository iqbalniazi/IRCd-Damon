 Known Bugs worthy of a mention:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
1.  /MODUNLOAD causes cores:
    - If a module is modified before being unloaded, /MODUNLOAD (and
      therefore /MODRELOAD) may cause a core.

      This problem is caused by the behaviour of the OS, which treats
      shared libraries differently to executables (modifying the ircd
      binary whilst it is running would also cause a core, but is denied
      by the OS).

      A workaround to avoid coring is possible however.  To install new
      modules, first remove or rename the old module, then copy/move the
      new file into place.  install or make install is also safe.
      /MODUNLOAD will then work successfully.

      We will likely have a workaround implemented in the next version.

BUG REPORTS: If you run this code and encounter problems, you must report
 the bug on http://bugs-meta.atheme.org/ (Charybdis project) or via IRC,
 irc.atheme.org #charybdis.

 Please include a gdb backtrace and keep your binaries, modules and core file
 in case the developers need more information.
