- Fix compilation without zlib.

-- charybdis-3.0.1

- Fix occasional hung clients with kqueue.
- Fix a rare ssld crash.
- Fix a bug that could cause incorrect connect failure reasons to be
  reported.
- Make the IRCd work on MacOS X again.

-- charybdis-3.0.0

- Port the IRCd to libratbox, which has improved our portability and allows
  us to reuse low-level code instead of maintaining our own.
- Change configuration of maximum number of clients to ircd-ratbox 3 way.
- Add adminwall from ircd-ratbox, as an extension.
- Add client and server-to-server SSL, read example.conf for setup.
- Replace servlink with ssld (also for ziplinks).
- A new extban, $z, has been added for ssl users (extensions/extb_ssl.so).
- A new compatibility channel mode, +R, has been added, it sets
  +q/-q $~a (extensions/chm_operonly_compat.so). This is similar to
  the +R seen in ircd-seven.
- A new compatibility channel mode, +S, has been added, it sets
  +b/-b $~z (extensions/chm_sslonly_compat.so).
- A new compatibility channel mode, +O, has been added, it sets
  +iI/-iI $o (extensions/chm_operonly_compat.so).
- Add remote D:lines. Note that these are not enabled by default.
- Remove EFnet-style G:lines. Noone appears to use these.
- Remove idle time checking (auto disconnecting users idle too long).
- Display a notice to clients when the IRCd is shut down using SIGTERM.
- Some error messages have been clarified to enhance usability.
- Close the link to servers that send invalid nicks (e.g. nicklen mismatches).
  Formerly the users were killed from the network.
- Enable topicburst by default in connect{}.
- Fix a potential desync which can happen with oper override.
- Remove "deopped" flag (TS5 legacy).

- Make some more server notices about failed remote connect attempts
  network wide.
- Make some server notices about flooders and TS delta network wide.
- Remove redundant "<server> had been connected for <time>" server notice.
- Add resv oper privilege to control /resv, /unresv and cmode +L and +P,
  enabled by default.
- Add mass_notice oper privilege to control global notices and /wallops,
  enabled by default.

  and do not rehash bans.
- Show opers a list of recently (<24hrs) split servers in /map.
- Add /privs command, shows effective privileges of a client.

-- charybdis-2.2.0

- The I/O code has been reworked, file descriptor metadata is stored in a
  hashtable and the maximum number of clients can now be set in ircd.conf.
- Improve error checking and error messages for kline/dline/xline/resv files.
- Allow kline ipv6:address, unkline some.host and unkline ipv6:address
  without *@.

  things like the user's IP address in the reason.
- Use sendto_one_notice() more.
- Server notices about kills now include the victim's nick!user@host instead
  of just nick.
- Include real hostname in Closing Link message for unknown connections
  that have sent USER, in particular banned users.
- Add some documentation about the SASL client protocol.
- Change spambot, flooder and jupe joiner notices from host to orighost.
- Remove the last remains of server hostmasking (this made it possible to
  have multiple servers with similar names appear as a single server).
- Keep bitmasks of modularized umodes reserved forever to the letter,
  avoiding problems when reloading umode modules in a different order.
- Fix -logfile.
- Update to the new revision (v8) of the TS6 spec, this fixes problems with
  joins reversing certain mode changes crossing them. This interoperates
  with older versions.
- Put "End of Channel Quiet List" at the end of +q lists.
- Fix invisible count getting desynched from reality if the act of opering
  up sets -i or +i.
- Don't leak auth{} spoofed IP addresses in +f notices.
- Shorten quit/part/kick reasons to avoid quit reasons overflowing the
  client exiting server notice (from TOPICLEN to 260).
- Fix some cases where 10 char usernames lose their final character.
- Move username check after xline and dnsbl checks, so it will not complain
  to opers about clients who are xlined or blacklisted anyway (both of
  which silently reject).
- Remove invite_ops_only config option, forcing it to YES.
- Allow /invite (but not invex) to override +r, +l, +j in addition to +i.

  single ban exception existed on a channel.
- Tweak \s code a little.
- Add a minor clarification to the SGML docs.

  to no longer match.

- Search the shortest list (user's/channel's) when looking up channel
  memberships.
- Make the SID-collision notice look right under all conditions.
